## Objectives

This lab demonstrates how to:

- Create Security Groups for controlled database access
- Configure DB Subnet Groups across multiple Availability Zones
- Deploy an Amazon RDS MySQL database
- Enable Multi-AZ high availability
- Connect a web application hosted on EC2 to RDS
- Understand secure communication between AWS services
- Test data persistence and database replication

# Lab Steps

---

## 1. Creating the DB Security Group

A dedicated Security Group was created to allow only the Web Security Group to communicate with the database through port `3306`.

### Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | MySQL/Aurora |
| Port | 3306 |
| Source | Web Security Group |

## 2. Creating the DB Subnet Group

A DB Subnet Group was configured using two subnets located in different Availability Zones to support Multi-AZ deployment.

### Selected Subnets

| Availability Zone | CIDR |
|---|---|
| us-east-1a | 10.0.1.0/24 |
| us-east-1b | 10.0.3.0/24 |

## 3. Configuring the Amazon RDS Instance

An Amazon RDS MySQL database instance was deployed with Multi-AZ enabled for high availability.

### Main Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Engine | MySQL |
| Deployment | Multi-AZ |
| Instance Type | db.t3.micro |
| Storage | 20 GB GP SSD |
| Database Name | lab |
| Username | main |

## 4. Retrieving the RDS Endpoint

After deployment, the database endpoint was retrieved from the RDS Connectivity & Security section.

This endpoint allows the EC2 web application to communicate securely with the database.

## 5. Connecting the Web Application to RDS

The provided EC2-hosted web application was configured to connect to the RDS database using:

- Endpoint
- Database name
- Username
- Password

After configuration, the application successfully persisted data inside the RDS database.

# Security Concepts Learned

This lab demonstrates several important AWS security practices:

- Principle of least privilege
- Private database deployment
- Security Group-based access control
- Database isolation inside private subnets
- Multi-AZ high availability architecture
- Controlled EC2 ↔ RDS communication

---

# Multi-AZ Architecture

Amazon RDS Multi-AZ automatically creates:

- One Primary database instance
- One Standby replica in another Availability Zone

Benefits:

- Automatic failover
- High availability
- Synchronous replication
- Increased durability
- Production-grade resilience

---

# Key Takeaways

During this lab, the following concepts were practiced:

- AWS networking fundamentals
- VPC segmentation
- Database security
- Managed database services
- High availability architecture
- EC2 to RDS communication
- Multi-AZ replication
- Cloud infrastructure design
